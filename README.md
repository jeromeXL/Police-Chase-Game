Background
In this assignment, you are the police! You will control four detectives as they travel through a network of cities trying to catch a thief.

The police are aiming for any of the four detectives to catch the thief before the thief escapes to the getaway city, and before the time runs out... and the aim of the thief is to reach the getaway city before they are caught.

The detectives have a map, but do not know where the thief is or where they are trying to get to. The thief also has a map but unfortunately they didn't take COMP2521, so they don't really know how to use it and they wander randomly through the cities trying to reach the getaway city. The detectives may employ different strategies depending on what they have been assigned to.

Game Rules
In this game, all the people (the four detectives and the thief) are known as agents, and the game consists of a series of turns, known as cycles.

Each agent starts in a city, determined by user configuration. Every cycle, each agent may move from their current city to an adjacent city by road. The goal of the detectives is to end up in the same city as the thief, which would allow them to catch the thief, while the goal of the thief is to reach the getaway city.

Each agent begins with some stamina, also determined by user configuration. Whenever an agent moves from one city to another, they lose stamina equal to the length of the road between them.

Agents cannot travel along a road if they do not have the required level of stamina. This means it is possible for an agent to have no legal moves. If an agent has no legal moves due to not having enough stamina, they must remain in their current city for another cycle. Remaining in the same city for a turn resets the agent's stamina back to its initial level.

Each detective uses a set strategy to navigate the cities, determined by user configuration. Meanwhile, the thief always moves randomly.

The game ends if one of the following conditions is met:

If a detective starts in the same city as the thief, the thief is caught immediately and the detectives win.
If a detective is in the same city as the thief at the end of a turn, the thief is caught and the detectives win.
If the thief is in the getaway city at the end of a turn and there are no detectives there, the thief escapes, so the thief wins.
If the time has run out, regardless of whether the thief was able to reach the getaway city, the trail has gone cold, so the thief wins.
Setting Up
Note: As this assignment uses random number generation, you may get different results if you run it on your local machine.

Change into the directory you created for the assignment and run the following command:

unzip /web/cs2521/22T2/ass/ass2/downloads/files.zip
If you're working at home, download files.zip by clicking on the above link and then run the unzip command on the downloaded file.

You should now have the following files:

Makefile
This controls compilation of the program. You only need to modify this if you create additional files for your implementation. It must produce an executable called game.

Map.h
This is the interface to the Map ADT. It provides agents with information about the world including what cities and roads there are. Roads always go between two different cities and can always be traversed in both directions, and all the cities will be connected, either directly or indirectly via other cities. You must not modify this file.

Map.c
This is the implementation of the Map ADT. At the moment it is just a stub file that you need to implement yourself. You can use any of the lab code or adapt any of the code from lectures to do this.

Agent.h
This is the interface to the Agent ADT. An instance of the Agent ADT represents an 'agent' in the game. An agent represents a detective or a thief. This interface includes functions to allow the agents to interact with the client program. You must not modify this file.

Agent.c
This is the implementation of the Agent ADT. At the moment this only supplies the implementation for the RANDOM movement strategy, and will need to be completed by you. Make sure you understand what has already been supplied.

game.c
This is the client program that runs the game. The program reads in data from some data files and creates a map. The agents are also created and a game starts. You must not modify this file.

data/
This is a directory containing test data that can be used as input to the program. There are two types of data files, which are described below.

cities*.data files
Sample city data files to use as a starting point for your testing. Some data files will have small numbers of cities, some will have more; some have informants, some don'tâ€¦ but you should also create your own data files.

agentsS*.data files
Sample agent data files that you can use once you have completed the different stages of the assignment. agentsS1.data can be used if you have implemented stage 1 and above, agentsS2.data can be used if you have implemented stage 2 and above, and so on. Note that stage 3 must be tested by using one of the city data files with informants. And, of course, you should create your own agents*.data files for testing.

The Client Program
Inputs
Command-Line Arguments
The client program should be invoked as follows:

./game <city data file> <agent data file> <cycles> [seed]
The program requires 3 command-line arguments with an optional fourth. The command-line arguments are

the name of the city data file

the name of the agent data file

the maximum number of cycles in the game

(optional) a seed value for the random number generator; by using the same seed, you can produce the same ordering of 'random' moves and repeat exactly the same situation.

City Data
The first line contains a single integer which is the number of cities. Then, for every city there will be a line of data. Each line begins with the ID of the city, which will always be between 0 and (the number of cities - 1), followed by pairs of integers indicating a road to another city of a certain length. After the roads are listed each line will contain either an 'n' or 'i'. An 'i' indicates that the city has an informant, while an 'n' indicates that it doesn't. At the end of each line is the name of the city.

For example, consider the following city data file:

10
0 5 29 1 41 6 60 7 50 8 40 n sydney
1 2 51 5 29 i adelaide
2 n melbourne
3 5 30 4 36 n perth
4 3 36 9 20 n darwin
5 1 29 0 29 3 30 6 10 n hobart
6 n auckland
7 n madrid
8 i new york
9 n brisbane
The first line indicates that there are 10 cities. The second line indicates that Sydney has an ID of 0, and has a road to Hobart of length 29, a road to Adelaide of length 41, a road to Auckland of length 60, a road to Madrid of length 50 and a road to New York of length 40. There is an informant in Adelaide and New York.

Agent Data
The first line of data represents information about the thief. The first number represents the amount of stamina the thief starts with, which is also the maximum amount of stamina the thief can have. The second number represents the starting location of the thief. The third number indicates where the getaway city is. This is followed by a string representation (i.e., name) of the thief.

The next four lines represent the detectives. The first two numbers represent the initial/maximum amount of stamina and the starting location of the detective. The third number represents the strategy that the detective is assigned. This is followed by a string representation (i.e., name) of the detective.

For example, consider the following agent data file:

10 5 6 T
1 2 0 D1
1 3 1 D2
5 1 2 D3
5 4 2 D4
The first line indicates that the thief has a stamina of 10 and starts at city 5 (which would be Hobart if using the city data file above), and that the getaway city is city 6 (which would be Auckland if using the city data file above).

Commands
Once the client program has started the initial state of the game will be displayed and the user will be prompted for input. The available commands are as follows:

Command	Description
run	This will run an entire simulation, printing out a trace of the agents' locations for each cycle of the game. It will print out how the game finished, i.e., with the thief being caught, getting away, or time running out.
step	This runs just one cycle of the game, printing out the new location of the agents for the next cycle. If the game finished in that cycle, it will also print out how the game finished. This allows the user to step through the game one cycle at a time.
stats	This prints out the status of each agent. This includes the name of the agents' current location and the agents' stamina.
display	This displays the current locations of all agents.
map	This prints out the map in a textual format, including the ID/name of each city, and the roads from each city and their length.
quit	Quits the game!
Task 1: Map Implementation
Your first task is to complete the implementation of the Map ADT in Map.c, which agents will use to get information about cities and roads.

Task 2: Agent Implementation
In this task, you must implement various strategies that the detectives can use to try and catch the thief in Agent.c. This will require you to modify existing functions and add new fields to the agent struct (to enable agents to remember things), so make sure you understand the existing code first.

Stage 0: RANDOM strategy
In stage 0, all agents use the random strategy. In the random strategy, each agent randomly selects an adjacent city that they have the required stamina to move to and move to it. If the agent does not have sufficient stamina to move to any city, they must remain in their current city for another cycle, which will completely replenish their stamina.

The random strategy has already been implemented, so you are not required to do anything to complete this stage. You should not alter the logic of the random strategy in Agent.c. You should also not use any random number generation in your implementation of the other strategies.

Stage 1: CHEAPEST_LEAST_VISITED strategy
If a detective is assigned this strategy, it means that at every opportunity they have to move, they must move to the city they have visited the least number of times, out of the legal options that are available. This means the detective must work out what cities are actually adjacent to the current city that they have sufficient stamina to move to and pick from those the one that has been visited the least. If there is more than one city with the same number of visits, the city which requires the least stamina among those should be chosen. If there is more than one city with the same number of visits and that requires the least stamina, the city with the lowest ID among those should be chosen.

Note that at the beginning of the game, a detective is considered to have visited its starting city once. Also, if a detective must remain in their current city, this counts as an additional visit, even though the detective did not move.

Stage 2: DFS strategy
In this stage a DFS strategy must be implemented. When following this strategy, the agent maps out an entire route that will take them through every city on the map using the DFS algorithm. If the DFS has a choice between multiple cities, it must prioritise the city with the lowest ID. At every cycle, the agent attempts to move to the next city on the plan. If the agent does not have enough stamina they must wait in the same city to recover. When the agent has visited all cities at least once, a new DFS path from the final location is mapped out and is followed.

For example, consider the following arrangement of cities and roads:


If an agent using the DFS strategy starts at city 5, then they should devise the following route: 5 â†’ 0 â†’ 1 â†’ 0 â†’ 6 â†’ 7 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 9 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 7 â†’ 8 â†’ 2. The route ends at city 2 because once the agent reaches city 2, they will have visited all the cities, and the next DFS would begin at city 2.

You can assume that the maximum stamina of each detective using the DFS strategy is greater than or equal to the length of the longest road, so no detective using the DFS strategy will be stuck forever at some city while trying to complete their route.

Stage 3: Least Turns Path
In this stage we will test your implementation using city data with informants. If a detective starts at, or moves to a city where there is an informant, they will discover where the thief is currently located. The detective must then find the path to that location that will take the least number of turns and then follow this path. Of course, the thief may be gone by the time the detective gets there, in which case the detective must restart their original strategy from their new location. Any cities the detective passes through on the shortest path are counted as being visited if the detective returns to the CHEAPEST_LEAST_VISITED strategy. The detective may also pass through a city with another informant in which the detective would find a new least turns path from the current location.

You must take into account the stamina of the agent. For example, if one path requires the agent to travel through 3 cities, but would have to rest twice (5 turns), that is more turns that an agent travelling through 4 cities but not having to rest (4 turns). If there are multiple paths that would take the least number of turns, the path that results in the agent having the most stamina at the end should be chosen. If there are multiple paths that would take the least number of turns and would also result in the agent having the same stamina, either path is valid.

You can assume that all detectives will be able to reach every city from every other city. That is, for every pair of cities, there exists a route between them such that the length of the longest road on that route is less than or equal to the maximum stamina of each detective.

Stage 2
In this example, detectives 3 and 4 use the DFS strategy. In this strategy they do a depth-first traversal from their starting points and follow this at each cycle. If they do not have the stamina to go to the next city on their route, they remain at the same location to regain their stamina and continue on the set path. (This happens even if there were other options they did have the stamina for.)

Detectives 1 and 2 are still following the CHEAPEST_LEAST_VISITED strategy and the thief is of course using the RANDOM strategy.

Stage 3
In this example, detectives 1 and 2 start with the CHEAPEST_LEAST_VISITED strategy and detectives 3 and 4 start with the DFS strategy. However detectives 1 and 4 start off in a city with an informant (this is indicated by the * character on the display), so they immediately switch to the strategy of going along the shortest path to the thief's current location (city 9). They calculate the shortest path as follows:

Detective 1 calculates the shortest path as 8 â†’ 0 â†’ 5 â†’ 3 â†’ rest â†’ 4 â†’ 9, which requires 6 turns.
Detective 4 calculates the shortest path as 8 â†’ 0 â†’ 5 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 9, which requires 5 turns.
Detective 4 reaches the destination by hour 5 but the thief is no longer there. However the other detectives have found the thief by this stage anyway. Detective 1 is following the shortest path from 8 to 9, but has to stop at hour 4 to regain stamina.

Detective 2 finds an informant in city 1 in hour 1 and goes via the shortest path from city 1 to 4, which is calculated as 1 â†’ 5 â†’ rest â†’ 3 â†’ 4.

Detective 3 finds an informant in city 1 in hour 3 and goes via the shortest path from city 1 to 4, which is calculated as 1 â†’ 5 â†’ 3 â†’ rest â†’ 4.

Reference Implementation
A reference implementation is available at:

/web/cs2521/22T2/ass/ass2/reference/game
If the reference implementation fails (e.g., segmentation fault, bus error, etc.) or behaves incorrectly according to the specification, please email cs2521@cse.unsw.edu.au and attach the test file or a description of the input that caused the failure/bug.

Frequently Asked Questions
Are we allowed to create our own functions? You are always allowed to create your own functions. All additional functions you create should be made static.
Are we allowed to create our own #defines and structs? Yes.
Are we allowed to change the signatures of the given functions? No. If you change these, your code won't compile and we won't be able to test it.
What errors do we need to handle? You should handle common errors such as NULL returned from malloc by printing an error message to stderr and terminating the program. You are not required to handle other errors.
What invalid inputs do we need to handle? You are not required to handle invalid inputs. It is the user's responsibility to provide valid inputs.
Will we be assessed on our tests? No. You will not be submitting any test files, and therefore you will not be assessed on your tests.
Are we allowed to share tests? No. Testing is an important part of software development. Students that test their code more will likely have more correct code, so to ensure fairness, each student should independently develop their own tests.
Submission
You must submit the files Map.c and Agent.c. In addition, you can submit as many supporting files (.c and .h) as you want. Please note that none of your submitted files should contain a main function, and you must not submit Map.h or Agent.h as you are not permitted to modify these files. You can submit via the command line using the give command:

give cs2521 ass2 Map.c Agent.c your-supporting-files...
You can also submit via give's web interface. You can submit multiple times. Only your last submission will be marked. You can check the files you have submitted here.

After you submit, you must check that your submission was successful by going to your submissions page. Check that the timestamp and files are correct. If your submission does not appear under Last Submission or the timestamp is not correct, then resubmit.

Compilation
You must ensure that your final submission compiles on CSE machines. Submitting non-compiling code leads to extra administrative overhead and will result in a 10% penalty.

Every time you make a submission, a dryrun test will be run on your code to check that it compiles. Please ensure that your final submission successfully compiles, even for parts that you have not completed.

To compile your submission, we will take the starting versions of Map.h, Agent.h and game.c, and then run the following command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -g -o game *.c
Assessment Criteria
This assignment will contribute 20% to your final mark.

Correctness
80% of the marks for this assignment will be based on the correctness of your code, and will be based on autotesting. Marks for correctness will be distributed as follows:

Map Implementation	15%
Agent Implementation	Stage 1	20%
Stage 2	25%
Stage 3	20%
Memory errors/leaks
You must ensure that your code does not contain memory errors or leaks, as code that contains memory errors is unsafe and it is bad practice to leave memory leaks in your program.

Our tests will include a memory error/leak test for each part of the assignment. If a memory error/leak arises from your code, you will receive a penalty which is 10% of the marks for that part. For example, the penalty for causing a memory error/leak in Stage 1 will be 2%. You can check for memory errors and leaks with the valgrind command:

valgrind -q --leak-check=full ./game command-line-arguments... > /dev/null
A program that contains no memory errors or leaks will produce no output from this command. You can learn more about memory errors and leaks in the Debugging with GDB and Valgrind lab exercise.

Style
20% of the marks for this assignment will come from hand marking of the readability of the code you have written. These marks will be awarded on the basis of clarity, commenting, elegance and style. The following is an indicative list of characteristics that will be assessed, though your program will be assessed wholistically so other characteristics may be assessed too (see the style guide for more details):

Consistent and sensible indentation and spacing
Using blank lines and whitespace
Using functions to avoid repeating code
Decomposing code into functions and not having overly long functions
Using comments effectively and not leaving planning or debugging comments
The course staff may vary the assessment scheme after inspecting the assignment submissions but it will remain broadly similar to the description above.

Originality of Work
This is an individual assignment. The work you submit must be your own work and only your work apart from the exceptions below. Joint work is not permitted. At no point should a student read or have a copy of another student's assignment code.

You may use any amount of code from the lectures and labs of the current iteration of this course. You must clearly attribute the source of this code in a comment.

You may use small amounts (< 10 lines) of general purpose code (not specific to the assignment) obtained from sites such as Stack Overflow or other publicly available resources. You must clearly attribute the source of this code in a comment.

You are not permitted to request help with the assignment apart from in the course forum, help sessions or from course lecturers or tutors.

Do not provide or show your assignment work to any other person (including by posting it publicly on the forum) apart from the teaching staff of COMP2521. When posting on the course forum, teaching staff will be able to view the assignment code you have recently submitted with give.

The work you submit must otherwise be entirely your own work. Submission of work partially or completely derived from any other person or jointly written with any other person is not permitted. The penalties for such an offence may include negative marks, automatic failure of the course and possibly other academic discipline. Assignment submissions will be examined both automatically and manually for such issues.

Relevant scholarship authorities will be informed if students holding scholarships are involved in an incident of plagiarism or other misconduct. If you knowingly provide or show your assignment work to another person for any reason, and work derived from it is submitted, then you may be penalised, even if the work was submitted without your knowledge or consent. This may apply even if your work is submitted by a third party unknown to you.
